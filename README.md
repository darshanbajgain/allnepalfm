## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across:

- Mobile devices (portrait and landscape)
- Tablets
- Desktops and large screens

The UI adapts intelligently to different screen sizes, with a collapsible sidebar on mobile and a persistent sidebar on larger screens.

## üéß Audio Player Implementation

The custom audio player was built from scratch using the HTML5 Audio API and React hooks. Key features include:

- **Streaming Support**: Handles live streaming audio sources
- **Buffering Indicators**: Visual feedback during stream loading
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable volume with mute toggle
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for stream issues
- **Minimizable Interface**: Toggle between full and minimized player views
- **Persistent Playback**: Continue listening while browsing different sections
- **Station Information**: Display current station details

Implementation highlights:

- Used React's `useRef` to manage the audio element
- Implemented custom event listeners for audio events (play, pause, buffering)
- Created a responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes
- Added drag functionality for the minimized player
- Integrated with the global state management for consistent playback state

## üé® UI/UX Design

The UI design follows modern web application principles with a focus on:

- **Clean, Minimalist Aesthetic**: Uncluttered interface with focus on content
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy-to-understand navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- **Consistent Design Language**: Uniform styling, spacing, and interactions
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and readable typography
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for loading, playing, and interactive elements

The Spotify-inspired sidebar provides quick access to main sections while the fixed player bar ensures continuous access to playback controls.

## üîÑ State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management, providing:

- **Player State**: Current station, playback status, volume
- **Search State**: Search terms and filters
- **Theme State**: Light/dark mode preferences

This approach allows for a clean, predictable state flow throughout the application.

## üåê API and Data

The application uses a mock API during development (via axios-mock-adapter) that simulates:

- Station listings by province
- Station categories and metadata
- Stream URLs and station information

In production, this would connect to a real backend service.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts**: Personal profiles with saved preferences
- **Social Sharing**: Share favorite stations with friends
- **Station Reviews**: User ratings and reviews for stations
- **Advanced Search**: More filtering and sorting options
- **Podcast Support**: Add podcast streaming capabilities
- **PWA Implementation**: Make the app installable on devices
